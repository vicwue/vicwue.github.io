Product Management (Marketing) / SAP SE / GERMANY (remote from New Zealand)
Focus on SAP Cloud Application Programming Model 
Unit: SAP Technology & Innovation Cloud Platform Extensions (July 2020 – February 2021, ~7 months)
Growing from a very technical dev-oriented toolset for application and service development by over half of the company, the product SAP CAPM quickly got the attention to be used additionally as an integration tool for customers. 
This Product Management (PM) setup was paired with a Chief Product Owner (CPO) heading three Product owners (POs). The term Rollout can be translated to the responsibility to update internal and external stakeholder communication to match expectations leveraged against the product, future proving current product strategy and advise the CPO going forward. This included e.g. where we would partner to create content with external Product Evangelists and where we would leverage internal Development Advocates. As well as relieving the CPO and the PO in external facing commitments for representing the product.

Vacation turned lockdown, turned into remote working from New Zealand  – March 2020


Product Management (Marketing) / SAP SE / GERMANY (remote, starting March 2020)
Focus on event preparation of HMI 2020 and product SAP Intelligent Product Design
Unit: SAP Digital Supply Chain (January 2020 – May 2020, ~5 months)
Rollout, in this case, meant information and decisions around implementation decisions, features and roadmap provided by CPO and POs had to be packaged in an understandable fashion for the Sales/Consultants as well as the customer representatives. The goal of this timeboxed professional internship was for me to better understand the deliverables of a PO/PM required by people downstream, but I always planned to return to a more hands-on role as a PO/PM. 
It was my responsibility to represent SAP Intelligent Product Design by demonstrating our SaaS cloud application at an internationally recognized conference of the manufacturing industry (HMI 2020) through a semi-fictional company running an end-to-end SAP scenario.


Product Manager (Product Development) / SAP SE / GERMANY
responsible for SAP Document Center, SAP Cloud Platform Document Service, SAP Cloud Platform Document Management
Unit: SAP Technology & Innovation Cloud Platform Products & Services (October 2018 – May 2020, ~2 years)
This hands-on role as a PM with the backing of two to three POs resembled more the tasks of a CPO.
My first goal was outlined to replace the Document Management tools on SAPs Cloud Platform via sunset and migration path for customers of two products: a SaaS document collaboration tool for the enterprise as well as a PaaS Document Management Service. 
PM tasks included prioritizing features & capabilities from a customer usage perspective and providing a migration-aware roadmap, broken down to several backlogs for the scrum teams, as well as communicating to our stakeholders e.g. where feature parity is not possible.
I was personally involved in the de-escalation management with various customers and could alleviate their concerns by providing exact Requirements Analysis and realistic time frames on a believable roadmap that I negotiated with the architects, POs and teams. 
My second goal was creating & affirming the product strategy by addressing all requirements in the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) domain inside SAP through including several additional POs from throughout the company as well as from partners and customers in our discussion. One cornerstone of this ECM strategy was shaping the new Document Management offering on SAP Cloud Platform based on the sunset of my two products and filling it with an option to form a Joint Venture with SAP Partner Opentext.
Expertise jumps like keeping the stakeholders informed on the high level through e.g. backlogs and roadmaps and keeping up to date with the detailed implications of decisions made on the technical side were crucial to establishing a broader understanding for all stakeholders and ensuring a deep customer focus at the same time.
Finally, through this diligence, we have discovered various commercial and technical discrepancies in the proposed architectural design with integrating the partner Opentext directly. This has forced me to reprioritize components in a true-to-form Agile fashion to first consume cloud-native commodities like AWS S3/Azure storage from the cloud vendors directly. Following on from that we achieved a win-win situation where the partner based joint venture integration would follow as an optional value add for our customers.

Project Lead / SAP SE / GERMANY
for Internal Program – focus on Machine Learning applied to PaaS Services
Unit: SAP Cloud Platform Technology & Innovation (March 2018 – September 2018, ~7 months)
The program goal was identifying and set up projects to support Machine Learning (ML) use cases inside our organization to increase the value of our PaaS offering. My task was bringing software experts that also are ML interested together and connect them to what each of them needs to further dive into their ideas. 
This required me to already have an understanding of the various categories, benefits and drawbacks of machine learning and data science. I could easily fulfill this requirement through my network of experts and having followed trends in the market in my spare time.

Product Management / SAP SE / GERMANY
Responsible for SAP Visualization Services
Unit: SAP Cloud Platform Product Management (October  2017 – February 2018, ~5 months)
After relinquishing my roles from NZ as PO and co-PO, I’ve concentrated my efforts on the Product Management tasks of preparing various SAP Visualization Services for launch. This involved rebranding and breaking down complex decisions that have been made into an easily consumable SDK and API format, roadmaps and bringing knowledge back to the wider audience in our company as well as our early adopter customers. 

Return and relocation to Germany (end of assignment) – November 2017


Product Owner / SAP NZ Limited / NEW ZEALAND
responsible for SAP Visual Business and co-responsible for SAP Visual Interaction Toolkit
Unit: SAP Cloud Platform Technology Platform User Interface (May 2016 – November 2017, ~1,5 years)
While working as a developer in 2015 I started working on an integration project which culminated in an organizational change to achieve synergy effects in our company-wide 3D visualization efforts. This meant value drivers and capabilities of two different proprietary 2D & 3D visualization UI libraries (SAP Visual Business and SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer) moved into a new combined library (SAP Visual Interaction Toolkit & SAP Visualization Services). Through my constant passion for a product-centric perspective, I was selected to lead this integration project. This appointment came via an International Assignment to NZ combined with a co-ownership of the new product. 
I was also singlehandedly responsible as a PO for establishing a team of developers that can maintain and improve the existing German-built 3D Visualization product (SAP Visual Business). This was a challenge with the NZ team missing previous exposure to the product as well as additional pressure through reduced staffing. This also meant that Product Management responsibilities (especially roadmap and external-facing representation) was taken up by me through the PO role.
In addition, I could leverage my previous experience in global teams as well as working with people with diverse cultural backgrounds and foster a spirit of trust and openness, not just in my own Scrum team but in the overall department. 
Balancing the business priorities of each of the distinct existing customer bases with new approaches resolved into a genuine future proof successor for both of the products being phased out, without violating any of our customer commitments. We are especially proud of the concept of modularized browser-based client tools that leverage an open API design that can optionally be fed through a set of commercialized cloud microservices that scale based on arbitrary complexities of visualizations of e.g. sensor data or Building plans in 3D CAD.

International Assignment, relocation to New Zealand – July 2016


Software Developer / SAP SE / GERMANY

Unit: SAP Cloud Applications (June 2013 – April 2016, ~3 years)
I worked in scrum teams of developers building UI Frameworks on top of SAPs equivalent to a scalable cloud application stack as well as our PaaS offering SAP Cloud Platform. I also worked as a developer in a team of designers for SaaS and mobile apps, showcasing the designer’s vision in the best light possible while also keeping it feasible.

User Interface Developer / SAP SE / GERMANY
Unit: SAP Cloud Platform Technology & Innovation (October 2012 – March 2013, ~6 months)
First fully-fledged Design Thinking style project for the organization. Scrum team consisting of a diverse skillset background, my generalist background enabled me to act in several roles, through leading interviews, conceptualizing ideas, contributing to front end and service developing in the web app as well as acting as a Scrum Master.
