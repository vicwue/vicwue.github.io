Focusing on keeping the day-to-day value delivery up during times of high attrition, steering product strategy away from MVP & fully bespoke towards a scalable product. Establishing generic product thinking and practice in a service-based startup meant breaking down barriers in mindset and workmodes.

Employing empathy to reduce friction in a fast-paced environment and tailor learning paths to the individuals.

Product Management (GTM/Marketing) / SAP SE / GERMANY (remote from New Zealand)
Unit: SAP Technology & Innovation Cloud Platform Extensions (July 2020 – February 2021, ~7 months)
Focus on SAP Cloud Application Programming Model Growing from a very technical dev-oriented toolset for application and service development by over half of the company, the product SAP CAPM quickly got the attention to be used additionally as an integration tool for customers. 
This Product Management (PM) setup was paired with a Chief Product Owner (CPO) heading three Product owners (POs). The term Rollout can be translated to the responsibility to update internal and external stakeholder communication to match expectations leveraged against the product, future proving current product strategy and advise the CPO going forward. This included e.g. where we would partner to create content with external Product Evangelists and where we would leverage internal Development Advocates. As well as relieving the CPO and the PO in external facing commitments for representing the product.

Unit: SAP Digital Supply Chain (January 2020 – May 2020, ~5 months)
Focus on event preparation of HMI 2020 and product SAP Intelligent Product Design
Rollout, in this case, meant information and decisions around implementation decisions, features and roadmap provided by CPO and POs had to be packaged in an understandable fashion for the Sales/Consultants as well as the customer representatives. The goal of this timeboxed professional internship was for me to better understand the deliverables of a PO/PM required by people downstream, but I always planned to return to a more hands-on role as a PO/PM. 
It was my responsibility to represent SAP Intelligent Product Design by demonstrating our SaaS cloud application at an internationally recognized conference of the manufacturing industry (HMI 2020) through a semi-fictional company running an end-to-end SAP scenario.
