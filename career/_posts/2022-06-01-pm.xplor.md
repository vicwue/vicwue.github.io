Focus on general Gym segment, Access Control and Mobile app domains 
(June 2022 â€“ August 2023)
<!--more-->

Member-facing B2B2C mobile app for iOS and Android platforms to integrate with the existing Xplor Recreation platform. With a focus on time-to-market over feature richness.

Starting as the only product role remaining after a restructuring from the original gym vertical team, working with the interim Product Lead on working on a plan of transitioning the 8 figure ARR of existing Clubware customers in AU/NZ towards a new solution based on an existing Platform in the Recreational Centers vertical. Sole responsibility on product discovery for a new whitelabel Mobile App, assisting temporarily handling similar responsibility for mapping out the Access Control Provider integration until resourcing could be resolved. Highlighting significant differences between the two verticals and their respective customer segments. Customer and Consumer Interviews to influence decision making based on Quantitative and Qualitative data.
## Key Achievements:
* Product Discovery: Initiated 3 cycles a 4 week of qualitative user research and synthesised the findings for decision making and requirements which resulted in confirmation of more than 50% of our requirements and saved 3 months cost of upcoming planned work.
* Prototype Validation: Lead efforts to bring stakeholders & users in for constant testing and validation sessions during the prototyping stages that have resulted in actionable quantitative feedback and increased the overall quality of the apps before investing into development.
* Collaboration With Design Team: Created synergies and managed risk by enabling tight collaboration virtually between the development function and the newly hired product design team; Aligned 3 remote teams across USA, EU and New Zealand with varying levels of project familiarity, while building new processes iteratively.
