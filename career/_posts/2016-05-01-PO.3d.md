## 3D & Geospatial Visualisation Team
Specialized team was hand-selected out of half designers, half UI developers developing visualisation software in the 3D and geospatial space—SAP’s version of Google Maps. Focused on feasibility studies, prototype development, and developer advocacy through training and demo jams. Later transitioned to a Product Owner role, shaping the roadmap and vision.

###  Key Achievements:

* Led feasibility studies and prototyping, ensuring the viability of new visualisation technologies.
* Acted as a developer experience advocate, driving adoption through lectures and demos.
* Successfully transitioned into a Product Owner role, influencing strategic product direction.
* Owned and contributed Guidelines [Fiori Design System Maps](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/maps/)

While working as a developer in 2015 I started working on an integration project which culminated in an organizational change to achieve synergy effects in our company-wide 3D visualisation efforts. This meant value drivers and capabilities of two different proprietary 2D & 3D visualisation UI libraries (SAP Visual Business and SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer) moved into a new combined library (SAP Visual Interaction Toolkit & SAP Visualisation Services).

## Product Owner – 3D Visualisation SDK
Pitched and successfully led the business case to unify two 3D visualisation capabilities across SAP (Germany & New Zealand) into a single SDK. Advocated for innovation while aligning different user segment needs. Ensured the visualisation component adhered to SAP’s UX design system, becoming the go-to expert in this area. Published internal and external guidance to support ecosystem-wide consistency.

### Key Achievements:

* Unified fragmented 3D visualisation solutions into a single SDK, improving maintainability.
* Provided UX design guidance, ensuring visualisation consistency across SAP applications.
* Conducted extensive user and developer research, aligning product strategy with actual needs.
* Owned and contributed Guidelines [Fiori Design System 3D](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/3d-viewport/)

Through my constant passion for a product-centric perspective, I was selected to lead this integration project. This appointment came via an International Assignment to NZ combined with a co-ownership of the new product. 

I was also singlehandedly responsible as a PO for establishing a team of developers that can maintain and improve the existing German-built 3D Visualisation product (SAP Visual Business). This was a challenge with the NZ team missing previous exposure to the product as well as additional pressure through reduced staffing. This also meant that Product Management responsibilities (especially roadmap and external-facing representation) was taken up by me through the PO role.

In addition, I could leverage my previous experience in global teams as well as working with people with diverse cultural backgrounds and foster a spirit of trust and openness, not just in my own Scrum team but in the overall department.

Balancing the business priorities of each of the distinct existing customer bases with new approaches resolved into a genuine future proof successor for both of the products being phased out, without violating any of our customer commitments. We are especially proud of the concept of modularized browser-based client tools that leverage an open API design that can optionally be fed through a set of commercialized cloud microservices that scale based on arbitrary complexities of visualisations of e.g. sensor data or Building plans in 3D CAD.
