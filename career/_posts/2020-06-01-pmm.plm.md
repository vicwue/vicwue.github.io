Product Management (Marketing) / SAP SE / GERMANY (remote, starting March 2020)

Rollout, in this case, meant information and decisions around implementation decisions, features and roadmap provided by CPO and POs had to be packaged in an understandable fashion for the Sales/Consultants as well as the customer representatives. The goal of this timeboxed professional internship was for me to better understand the deliverables of a PO/PM required by people downstream, but I always planned to return to a more hands-on role as a PO/PM. 
It was my responsibility to represent SAP Intelligent Product Design by demonstrating our SaaS cloud application at an internationally recognized conference of the manufacturing industry (HMI 2020) through a semi-fictional company running an end-to-end SAP scenario.
