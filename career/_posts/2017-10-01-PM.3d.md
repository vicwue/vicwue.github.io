<!--more-->

After relinquishing my roles from NZ as PO and co-PO, I’ve concentrated my efforts on the Product Management tasks of preparing various SAP Visualization Services for launch. This involved rebranding and breaking down complex decisions that have been made into an easily consumable SDK and API format, roadmaps and bringing knowledge back to the wider audience in our company as well as our early adopter customers. 

SAP Visualisation Services, proprietary geospatial, 2D, 3D & 3D CAD visualization UI libraries, especially roadmap and external-facing representation. Browser based JS & native Mobile viewing components as well as PaaS services.
