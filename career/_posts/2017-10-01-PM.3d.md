## Product Manager – SAP 3D Visualisation Services
Transitioned to Product Manager for Visualisation Services, integrating cloud-based solutions for complex CAD file processing. Led stakeholder management, identified target customer segments, and shaped licensing strategies. Successfully open-sourced a component, reducing barriers to adoption and monetizing value-added business data services.

### Key Achievements:

* Designed a pricing and licensing model balancing open-source accessibility with revenue.
* Open-sourced a key component, driving adoption while monetizing advanced features.
* Combined design expertise with commercial strategy, shaping a scalable product vision.

After relinquishing my roles from NZ as PO and co-PO, I’ve concentrated my efforts on the Product Management tasks of preparing various SAP Visualisation Services for launch. This involved rebranding and breaking down complex decisions that have been made into an easily consumable SDK and API format, roadmaps and bringing knowledge back to the wider audience in our company as well as our early adopter customers. 

SAP Visualisation Services, proprietary geospatial, 2D, 3D & 3D CAD visualisation UI libraries, especially roadmap and external-facing representation. Browser based JS & native Mobile viewing components as well as PaaS services.
