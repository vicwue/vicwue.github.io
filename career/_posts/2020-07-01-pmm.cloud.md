Growing from a very technical dev-oriented toolset for application and service development by over half of the company, the product SAP CAPM quickly got the attention to be used additionally as an integration tool for customers.

This Product Management (PM) setup was paired with a Chief Product Owner (CPO) heading three Product owners (POs). The term Rollout can be translated to the responsibility to update internal and external stakeholder communication to match expectations leveraged against the product, future proving current product strategy and advise the CPO going forward. This included e.g. where we would partner to create content with external Product Evangelists and where we would leverage internal Development Advocates. As well as relieving the CPO and the PO in external facing commitments for representing the product.
