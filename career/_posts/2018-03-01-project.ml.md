## Project Lead – Machine Learning Integration
The program goal was identifying and set up projects to support Machine Learning (ML) use cases inside our organization to increase the value of our PaaS offering. My task was bringing software experts that also are ML interested together and connect them to what each of them needs to further dive into their ideas. 
This required me to already have an understanding of the various categories, benefits and drawbacks of machine learning and data science. I could easily fulfill this requirement through my network of experts and having followed trends in the market in my spare time.

## Key Achievements:

* Spearheaded the forming of a communinity for integration of ML-driven enhancements, improving usage internally.
* Coordinated between engineering and data science teams, ensuring seamless deployment.
* Identifying Machine Learning (ML) use cases in our organization to increase the value of our platform offering.
