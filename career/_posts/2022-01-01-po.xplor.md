Working in a team of recently promoted Product Owners while seperately reporting to the Global Product Lead. Full Product Discovery responsibility in my domain around integration of SMS and Email Marketing Providers and automation. Interacting with commercial stakeholders to achieve a viable scope definition, exploring customer segmentation to come up with a phased approach. Contributing and negotiation of Public Roadmap together with cross domain efforts. 
Responsible for a fresh domain with delivery targets behind schedule during a period of rapid change. Accountable for correspondence functionality via Email and SMS as part of the larger team building feature parity in the cloud SaaS successor product to on-premises Clubware Core. 
### Key Achievements:
* Stakeholder Management: Managed expectations and provided a ‘face’ for senior commercial stakeholders and customers by communicating transparently and with realistic commitments, after several milestones had been missed prior to taking over this domain. 
* Strategic Leadership: Developed effective strategies for this domain, by focusing on compliance through managing opt-ins for Marketing and Transactional Correspondence, as well as integration with third-party functionality.
